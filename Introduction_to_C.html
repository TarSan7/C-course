		<h1 class="text_h1">Introduction to C</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="text">The C (si) programming language is one of the most popular and common languages.
						It represents a general-purpose compiled programming language with static typing, 
						developed in 1969-1973 at Bell Labs by programmer Dennis Ritchie.</p>
		<p class="text">The C language is often called the programming language of the "middle level" or even "low level",
						as it combines elements of high-level languages ​​with the functionality and performance of assembler 
						and works close to the hardware of the computer. As a result, we can manipulate the data at a low level
						and at the same time use high-level constructs to control the program.</p>
		<p class="text">Initially, the C language was intended for writing the Unix operating system.
						Subsequently, C became one of the popular languages, and its main field of application
						was system programming, in particular, the creation of operating systems, drivers, various utilities,
						antiviruses, etc. By the way, Linux is mostly written in C. However, the use of this language is not
						limited only to system programming. This language can be used in programs at any level where speed and 
						performance are important.So, we can write with C and application applications, and even websites 
						(using CGI technology - Common Gateway Interface). But, of course, for the creation of a graphical
						interface and web applications, as a rule, more suitable tools and technologies are chosen, 
						but nevertheless, the range of use of C is quite wide. This largely determined the popularity
						of the language. For example, in the well-known ranking of programming languages ​​TIOBE, language
						C has long been confidently holding the second place.</p>
		<p class="text">Despite its great potential, C is quite simple at the same time. It does not contain many designs,
						libraries, it is easy to learn and learn. Therefore, it is often chosen as a language for studying
						programming in general.</p>
		<p class="text">C is a compiled language, which means that the compiler translates the C source code into an 
						executable file that contains a set of machine instructions. But different platforms have their
						own peculiarities, so compiled programs cannot simply be transferred from one platform to another
						and already run there. However, at the source code level, C programs are portable, and the 
						availability of compilers, libraries, and development tools for almost all common platforms 
						allows you to compile the same C source code into applications for these platforms.</p>
		<p class="text">The development of C has had a great influence in general on the development of programming languages.
						In particular, its syntax became the basis for languages ​​such as C ++, C #, Java, PHP, JavaScript. 
						Of particular note is the connection with C ++. C ++ is directly descended from C. But subsequently,
						their development took place separately from each other, and even incompatibility appeared between 
						them. The C99 standard has added a number of features that conflict with C ++ to the C language. As 
						a result, at present, both languages ​​are virtually self-sufficient and are developing independently.</p>
		<h2 class="text_h2">Key Features of C</h2>
		<ul class="text">
			<li>Versatility - the same code can be compiled on almost every platform (if there is a compiler for it) </li>
			<li>High execution speed </li>
			<li>Compact, small output compiled files </li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="text_h2">The main stages of development</h2>
		<p class="text">In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of their famous work, 
						The C Programming Language. For a long time, this book served as an informal specification of 
						the C language. However, the rapid spread of C led to the need for common standards. And in 1983,
						ANSI (American National Standards Institute) created a committee to develop the C specification. 
						And in 1989, the specification was approved. This version of the language is commonly called ANSI
						C or C89. In 1990, the ANSI C specification was slightly supplemented by the International 
						Organization for Standardization (ISO). The new standard became known as ISO / IEC 9899: 1990 
						or abbreviated C90.</p>
